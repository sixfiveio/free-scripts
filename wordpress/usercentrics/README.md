# Consent Management with Termageddon, UserCentrics and Google Consent Mode v2
## üìù Overview
This WordPress plugin provides a robust and compliant integration solution for modern privacy requirements.

It is specifically engineered to work seamlessly with Usercentrics Consent Management Platform (CMP), [Termageddon](https://go.sixfive.io/termageddon), and Google Tag Manager (GTM) Consent Mode v2.

The plugin ensures that your Usercentrics scripts are loaded correctly and that Google Tag Manager is initialized appropriately to handle consent signals and manage all subsequent marketing and analytics tags.

You can get UserCentrics CMP via [Termageddon](https://go.sixfive.io/termageddon) direct (affiliate link), or you can engage SixFive to do the setup and installation for you [Legals for your Website](https://sixfive.io/products/wordpress/legals/) 

## ‚ú® Features
Optimal Script Loading: Preloads and inserts the necessary Usercentrics uc-block.bundle.js script high in the <head> for maximum speed and compliance.

Termageddon Translation Support: Automatically configures Usercentrics to use custom translations hosted by Termageddon.

GTM Consent Mode v2 Ready: Explicitly excludes the Google Tag Manager container script from Usercentrics' automatic blocking mechanism, enabling GTM to control consent mode and manage tags based on user choice.

DoubleClick Ad (DFP) Support: Automatically modifies common DoubleClick Ad script handles (jquery_dfp and google_dfp) to include the required data-usercentrics attribute, ensuring ad scripts are only loaded after the necessary consent is given.
